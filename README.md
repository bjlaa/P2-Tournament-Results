# Tournament Results

The goal, while building this project, was to create a database schema to store the game matches between pairs of players. The tournament is rules by the Swiss Pairing system.

In order, to observe if the schema is working well run the tournament_test.py files in your terminal.

===================================
To do so a few steps are to follow:
===================================

* open Terminal
* change directory to the vagrant file
* once in the file, type in: vagrant up
* once the command is executed type in: vagrant ssh
* the next step is to type in: cd /vagrant
* run the command: python tournament_test.py

Observe the results.
